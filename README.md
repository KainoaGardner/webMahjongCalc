Mahjong is a game with a lot of rules which can be overwhelming for
newer players. One of the hardest parts to remember, even for more
experienced players, is the scoring of a hand, specifically fu. This
tool was made to make the process of scoring a hand easier and allows
the user enters a hand. The tool will also show tenpai when 13 tiles
are in the hand so it works as a tenpai finder as well which is useful
for beginners and more complicated waits. The tool will show total
score of a hand along with both dealer and non dealer payments. It
also shows all the yaku included in the hand with their han amount as
well as the fu of the hand. Users can also add dora, uradora, and
akadora as well as adjust options that affect the score of the hand
such as riichi and win type (ron / tsumo). The yaku page contains a
list of all standard yaku along with a brief description of the yaku
and example hands. The fu/scoring page has a brief overview on how to
count a hands fu amount and calculate a score for a hand as well as
useful scoring charts to memorize or streamline the scoring process.
